**Novel multimodal working memory task for investigating two modalities: visual and verbal**

I created these two files to (as can be easily guessed by the names):
- generate a set of stimuli for our novel WM task;
- create unique sequences of stimuli for each participant.


*NOTE:* The set of stimuli is created for Russian alphabet.
Hense, when developing the rules for stimuli and sequence generation we ONLY considered the graphic and phonological characteristics of cyrillic letters.
If you would like to use these scripts for non-Russian speaking sample, you should work out the set of rules based on the characteristics of your language.

Should you have any questions or comments concerning these scripts,
do not hesitate to contact me via email:
